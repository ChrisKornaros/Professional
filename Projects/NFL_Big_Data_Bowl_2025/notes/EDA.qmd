# Initial Exploration: Relationship Between Record (W-L) and Play Data {#sec-init_explore}
## Goal {#sec-goal}
I want to run a simple cluster analysis to see if there is a relationship between team records and their mix of plays. I'll need the games table for the teams and game outcomes. I'll also need either the tracking data, player_play data, or both to get a data for what happens each play. I have the following query to sort NFL teams by their W-L record as of Week 9 in 2022 (the year the data is for).

Prior to the larger analysis, I'll do an initial KNN analysis of the tracking data, by creating dummy variables for the teams.
- One hot encoding did not provide much value, data was overfit when looking at one target variable
- Next, I'll try a few different kinds of encoding
  - Binary Encoding
  - Frequency Encoding
- For Frequency Encoding, I'm switching to a Linear Regression
  - Continuous target variables aren't compatible with the KNN model
-
